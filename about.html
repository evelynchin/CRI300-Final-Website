				<p class="post">Coffee Crush was started in 2014 by a group of four friends while studying in Toronto, Canada. They love coffee and strive to bring the best coffee from around the world to the doorsteps of fellow coffee lovers.

				<p class="post">This is a fictional coffee bean delivery site created as a final project for CRI300 by Evelyn Chin.
				<br><br>
				I have past experience with front-end web development however this is the largest project that I've completed. I used HTML, CSS + Bootstrap framework & Javascript + jQuery.   
				<br><br>
				I believe my front-end development skills have vastly improved from working on this. In the past I've always worked on simple projects that focused on one thing (e.g. Bootstrap, flexboxes, responsive design), but I was able to compile all my past knowledge into this one project. 
				<br><br>
				I chose to do a coffee subscription company because coffee is extremely popular and there are many existing coffee subscription services that show it is a viable business. I chose to keep the layout and colour scheme simple. I think large photos that span the entire width of the viewport serve as good dividers and works really well on the publishing platform, Medium.
				<br><br>
				The biggest problem I had was my navbar was not toggling when the viewport width was below 786px. I was able to fix this by adding a missing class (dropdown) to my list elements.
				<br><br>
				If I could redo this project, I would have taken a mobile first approach. There was a lot of initial trouble with making the site responsive but I was able to solve that by using flexboxes. Also when the site is scaled down, the photos don't clip at the photo focal point. I tried to use a CSS clipping mask but was unsucessful at trying to do so.  
				<br><br>
				In the future I'd really like to improve upon my knowledge of javascipt + jQuery. As well, I'd like to learn how to create more complex web layouts.</p>
